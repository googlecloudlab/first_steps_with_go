# Using Documentation

Learning how to find documentation and APIs is key.

A tremendous amount of documentation exists on https://golang.org/doc. We recommend you peruse the site a few times to understand what is there in case you have a question later. The following are choice documents we recommend every Go developer be familiar with.
- [How to write Go code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html)
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- [FAQ](https://golang.org/doc/faq)
  
Go API documentation is housed here: https://golang.org/pkg. You can quickly see what's included in the box here.

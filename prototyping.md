# Prototyping

In the course of your work, you may wish to prototype something outside of your workspace. To that end, Go offers "playground", an easy-to-use REPL.

If you took the Go Tour, you certainly used it.
Visit the [External Playground](https://play.golang.org) and click "Run". You can prototype with nearly any package in the standard library.

Here are a few source code examples to get started. Copy and paste the code from the following example files into the Go playground.

- [Generics](source/generics.go)
- [Threading](source/threading.go)
- [Channels](source/channels.go)
- [Fuzzing](source/fuzzing.go) with [Test](source/reverse_test.go)

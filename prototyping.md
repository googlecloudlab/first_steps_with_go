# Prototyping

In the course of your work, you may wish to prototype something outside of your workspace. To that end, Go offers "playground", an easy-to-use REPL.

If you took the Go Tour, you certainly used it.
Visit the [External Playground](https://play.golang.org) and click "Run". You can prototype with nearly any package in the standard library.

# Interesting Facts About Go

- Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson designed Go at Google in 2007.
- Google wants an alternative to C++ and solves the issues of software engineering, this gives rise to the development of the Go programming language.
- Go is an open-source project. Source code for its compiler, libraries, and tools is freely available to anyone.
- Go is sometimes described as a "C-like language", or as "C for the 21st century".
- Go is supported on almost every  Operating system like DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, Solaris, and Windows. 
- Go's standard library, often described as coming with "batteries included", provides clean building blocks and APIs for I/O, text processing, graphics, cryptography, networking, and distributed applications, with support for many standard file formats and protocols.
- The [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) provides the ability to run Go programs. It can be embedded within other pages or documentation pages.
- Go provides 2 features that are capable of replacing Class inheritance. The first is embedding and the other is interfaces.
- Go has garbage collection which automatically performs memory management and permits deferred execution of functions.
- In Go language, we don’t need to put a comma (, ) at the end of statements like Python.
- There is a special Keyword in Go called ‘defer‘, which delays the execution of method or function until the nearby function returns.
- Go has a special built-in function known as ‘make‘, which is used to create slices, maps, and channels.
- If any variable or package is declared but not used then, the Go compiler will show an error.
- In Go, there is a new data type known as ‘slice‘, which has a more powerful interface to sequences as compared to Arrays.
- Sometimes we want to import packages only for their side effects, without exploiting their use like import _ “net/http/pprof”. For this purpose, the Go language is very useful.
- The ‘Goroutines‘ is a special function in Go, which runs concurrently with other functions or methods. 
- In order to establish communication between goroutines. There exists a pipe known as ‘Channels‘.
- Go programs compile to a single binary and do not require any additional software to be installed in order to run them. Install the Go development tools only on computers that build Go programs.
- Go's method for publishing code is a bit different than most other languages. Go developers don't rely on a centrally hosted service, like Maven Central for Java or the NPM registry for JavaScript. Instead, they share projects via their source code repositories.
- Go does not allow flexibility on how the code is laid out and enforces a standard format.

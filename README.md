# First Steps with Go

Welcome to First Steps with Go. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of the golang programming language.  Prior programming experience will be helpful but is not required.

Go is a next-generation, open-source programming language created by Google for building systems, web, and other applications. This workshop is designed to help developers get started with Go, covering its core language elements and syntax. We will introduce tools and skills used in a Go workflowâ€”including Go Playground, an online tool that takes Go development off the desktop.

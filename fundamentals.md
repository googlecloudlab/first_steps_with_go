## Fundamentals

The best way to learn Go's fundamentals is to first complete the official [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/). You will use an interactive web-based editor to accomplish basic tasks with the language.

You may also wish to pick up [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan.

To get started writing web applications, watch [A simple programming environment](https://vimeo.com/53221558) ([slides](https://go.dev/talks/2012/simple.slide)) and read the [Writing Web Applications tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/).

[Tutorial: Getting started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started.html)
A brief Hello, World tutorial to get started. Learn a bit about Go code, tools, packages, and modules.

[A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)
An interactive introduction to Go in three sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. You can [take the tour online](https://go.dev/tour/) or install it locally with:
$ go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest

This will place the tour binary in your GOPATH's bin directory.

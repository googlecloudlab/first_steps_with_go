# Tutorials

The best way to learn Go's fundamentals is to first complete the official [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/). You will use an interactive web-based editor to accomplish basic tasks with the language. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. You can [take the tour online](https://go.dev/tour/) or install it locally with:
`$ go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest` This will place the tour binary in your GOPATH's bin directory.

Throughout the [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/) you will be presented with Exercises that you can try to solve on your own. If you get stuck, check out the [Solutions](solutions.md) to the Exercises.

Next, you can check out some of the [Tutorials](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial) that are provided on the Go website. 

You may also wish to pick up [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan.

To get started writing web applications, watch [A simple programming environment](https://vimeo.com/53221558) ([slides](https://go.dev/talks/2012/simple.slide)) and read the [Writing Web Applications tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/).
